# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by email to `delatte.hugo@gmail.com`.

If the security vulnerability is accepted, a patch will be crafted privately
in order to prepare a dedicated bugfix release as timely as possible (depending
on the complexity of the fix).

In addition to sending the report by email, you can also report security
vulnerabilities to [tidelift](https://tidelift.com/security).
